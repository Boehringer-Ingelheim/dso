_DSO_ is a command line helper for building reproducible data anlaysis projects with ease.
It builds on top of [dvc](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) for data versioning and provides project
templates, linting checks, hierarchical overlay of configuration files and integrates with quarto and jupyter notebooks.

At Boehringer Ingelheim, we introduced DSO to meet the high quality standards required for biomarker analysis
in clinical trials. DSO is still under early development and we value community feedback.
