# Getting started

## `dso init` -- Initialize a project

`dso init` initializes a new project in your current directory.

```{command-output} dso init test_project --description "This is a test project"

```

It creates the root directory of your project with all the necessary configuration files for `git`, `dvc`, `uv` and
`dso` itself:

```{command-output} ls -a test_project

```

## `dso create` -- Add folders or stages to your project

We consider a _stage_ an individual step in your analysis, usually a script with defined inputs and outputs.
Stages can be organized in _folders_ with arbitrary structures. `dso create` initializes folders and stages
from predefined templates. We recommend naming stages with a numeric prefix, e.g. `01_` to declare the
order of scripts, but this is not a requirement.

```{bash}
cd test_project

# Let's create a folder that we'll use to organize all analysis steps related to "RNA-seq"
dso create folder RNA_seq

# Let's create first stage for pre-processing
cd RNA_seq
dso create stage 01_preprocessing --template bash --description "Run nf-core/rnaseq"

# Let's create a second stage for quality control
dso create stage 02_qc --template quarto --description "Perform RNA-seq quality control"
```

Stages have the following pre-defined folder-structure. This folder system aims to make the structure coherent throughout a project for easy readability and navigation. Additional folders can still be added if necessary.

```
stage
     | -- input            # contains Input Data
     | -- src              # contains Analysis Script(s)
     | -- output           # contains TLF - Outputs generated by Analysis Scripts
     | -- report           # contains HTML Report generated by Analysis Scripts
```
