--   The [myst][] extension allows to write documentation in markdown/Markedly Structured Text
--   [Numpy-style docstrings][numpydoc] (through the [napoloen][numpydoc-napoleon] extension).
--   Jupyter notebooks as tutorials through [myst-nb][] (See [Tutorials with myst-nb](#tutorials-with-myst-nb-and-jupyter-notebooks))
--   [sphinx-autodoc-typehints][], to automatically reference annotated input and output types
--   Citations (like {cite:p}`Virshup_2023`) can be included with [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/)

--   If building the documentation fails because of a missing link that is outside your control,
-    you can add an entry to the `nitpick_ignore` list in `docs/conf.py`
